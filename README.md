## FAQ

- **How do I give someone a Client Nickname?** Right click on the user and select the `Change Client Nickname` option. A modal should pop-up where you can give them a nickname, either for that or globally.
- **How do I reset a Client Nickname I gave someone?** Just set their Client Nickname to blank. There's also a reset client nickname link which helps you blank the text box.
  
## Known Issues

- **This doesn't work for people with a default avatar.** This plugin relies on a user's ID to differentiate between other users. Currently the only way to get a user's ID is from their avatar's url. Default avatar urls do not contain the user's ID.
